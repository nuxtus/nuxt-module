# Nuxtus Nuxt Module

The Nuxtus Nuxt module provides Nuxt applications with a suite of tools that make dealing with Directus and Nuxt easier. This includes endpoints for automatically adding Directus collections to Nuxt, typing these collections and an automatic authentication plugin.

It can be used independently but was built for the [Nuxtus Boilerplate](https://github.com/nuxtus/nuxtus) which creates a Directus/Nuxt project with one command and is the recommended way to use this Nuxt module. Alternatively you can set up an existing Nuxt project by following the [Getting Started](#getting-started) instructions below.
